# [Odoo Icon Builder](https://ivantodorovich.github.io/odoo-icon/)

Build and export beautiful Odoo app icons and export them to SVG or PNG.

## Examples

![Cloud](samples/cloud.svg)
![Euro](samples/euro.svg)
![Bitcoin](samples/bitcoin.svg)
![Health](samples/health.svg)
![School](samples/school.svg)

## Motivation

There are already some tools out there that do the same, but none of them supports
exporting to SVG.

SVG will be used as the default icon format in Odoo 16.0+ ([ref](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/10a5796d4b86a679f905be14a13b89026d645074))
due to its loading time speed, and thus we need a way to generate them.
